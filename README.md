# Image Patch Similarity
An attempt to implement an approach to find rotation-invariant patch similarities, 
which was proposed in the paper [Color-based and rotation invariant self-similarities](https://hal-ujm.archives-ouvertes.fr/ujm-01486570/document).

Unfortunately, the results from the paper could not be reproduced exactly. However, the 
implementation still seems to give useful results.
